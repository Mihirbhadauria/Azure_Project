- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**: Data storage solution.
- **Azure Databricks**: Data processing and transformation.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Data warehousing and analytics.
- **Power BI**: Business intelligence and data visualization.
- **Azure Active Directory & Azure Key Vault**: Security and compliance.

## Implementation
The project follows a structured approach, ensuring data integrity and security:
1. Extract data from SQL Server using ADF.
2. Process and transform data via Azure Databricks in a multi-layered data lake.
3. Load the transformed data into Azure Synapse for analytics.
4. Use Power BI to create actionable insights from data.
5. Employ Azure AD and Key Vault for authentication and key management.

## Impact
This project is a testament to my ability to handle complex data migrations and transformations, demonstrating my technical proficiency and strategic thinking in cloud-based solutions.
